The folders are organized as follows:

"MAE_graph_bars" contains the code, models, and data for the analysis and visualization of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) graphs for each of the ignition cases under study. 

"PCA_MAE_heat_maps"contains the data and models used for the construction of the PCA heat maps of the MAE distribution in accordance to manifold size and chemical specie. 

"TAE_MAE_heat_maps"contains the data and models used for the construction of the TAE heat maps of the MAE distribution in accordance to manifold size and chemical specie.

"TAE_reconstructions" contains the scripts related to the chemical species reconstruction using the TAE model z=2. 

"PCA_reconstrctions" contains the scripts related to the chemical species reconstruction using the PCA model z=2.
