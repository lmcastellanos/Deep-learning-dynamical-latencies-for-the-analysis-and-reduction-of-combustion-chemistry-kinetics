The file "TAE_MAE_bar_graphs" contains the code used to construct the heat maps related to the TAE models reconstruction, the folders "k_fold_best_model_testz"
contain the z-size TAE models. 

The MAE_values image files are for the MAE bar graphs without a y-axis limit, therefore, it is possible to visualize the 
error value with more precision; the TAE_MAE image files have a y-axis limit so it is possible to make a perspective 
in relation to the PCA errors. 

The data files included are the ones from the isobaric batch reactors from the tested ignition cases.
