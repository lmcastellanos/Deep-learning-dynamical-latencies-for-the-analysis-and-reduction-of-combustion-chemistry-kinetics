This folder contains the scripts used for the analysis of the permutation importance test. In brief, a linear hypotheses which use the chemical
carriers as inputs, and reconstructs the thermochemical variables is considered. This is likely to highlith direct influences of a chemical 
carrier concentration with an chemical output variable; in case this importance values is high, it means it is very likely there is a chemical
pathway that relates both chemical species. 

The "Permitation_importance_manifold_z" files are the ones that execute this analysis for each manifold of z-size. The data from 
the studied ignition cases is also provided. The .jpg files are the same images available in the jupyter notebooks.
