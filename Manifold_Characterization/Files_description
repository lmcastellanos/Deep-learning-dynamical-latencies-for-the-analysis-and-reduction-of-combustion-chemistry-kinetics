These folders contain the coding files used for the study of the TAE latencies; in the folder "TAE_Manifold_Correlation_analysis", it is possible
to find the files regarding the Kendall Tau B correlation indexes for each manifold size that is studied, leading to the determination of the 
chemical carriers. More details of the files arrangement
is available in the respective "File_description" (inside the folder).

In the case of the folder "TAE_Manifolds_permutation_importance", the files related to the permutation importance test are allocated, this 
kind of analysis allows to determinate influences of the chemical carriers into other chemical varaibles. As in all the folders in this 
repository, the respective "File description" (inside the folder) provides more details.
