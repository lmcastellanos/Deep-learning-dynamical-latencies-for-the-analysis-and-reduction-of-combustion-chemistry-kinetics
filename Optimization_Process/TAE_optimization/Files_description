The files allocated corrrespond to the keras tunner function application for the network architecture definition (number of layers and 
perceptrons), as well as the the posterior cross validations applied. The last ones had the purpose to obtain the exact weights and biases 
for the network. 

The "optimizaton_red-z.py" files correspond to the network architecture defintion, z is substitued by the number of reduced components
that are used in each case. 

In the other hand, the "san_diego_cross_validation_redz.py" are the files used for the cross validations and fine hyperparatmeter
tunning, again, z is substitued by the number of reduced components of each model.
