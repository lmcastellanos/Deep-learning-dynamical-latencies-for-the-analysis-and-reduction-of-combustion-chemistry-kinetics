The files organization is as follows, the "time_integrator_test" file contains the behavior of the model with manifold size 3 in an 
autoregressive application, which means that the output at the first time step is used ad the input for the next time step; it is to remark
the appeareance of outliers. 

On the other hand, the "temperature_autoregression_analysis" file makes referent to the temperature variations that are applied when the model
is used in an autoregressive mode, this files highlight the huge temporal errors that arise when small deviations of temperature are obtained 
as outputs. This means that is is not only important to minimize the error values in the point of interest, but also apply constrains regarding
the temporal 'growing'of the variables of interest. 

Lastly, the file "Z_dynamics" presents a temporal intepretation of the dynamical behavior of the latencies, while highlighting the difficulties
of an accurate calculation. 

The folder "TAE_z3_best_model" contains the tensorflow files related to the model manifold size 3, which is the same model used for this 
bottleneck configuration in all calculations.
