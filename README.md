Script files for the analysis of TAE Applications in combustion chemistry kinetics analysis and reduction. 

The "optimization_process" folder contains the codes used for the hyperparameter tuning of all the models analyzed.

The "training R2 scores" folder contains the check-up of accuracy in the training data.

The "manifold_characterization" folder contains the code used for the analysis of the TAE-reduced latencies. 

The "PCA_comparison" contains the files related to the comparison between the PCA and the TAE techniques.

The presented codes are used in interpolation ignition cases, however, they can be used for extrapolation analysis with minor changes. The extrapolation ignition cases data is provided in the folder "extrapolation_cases".
